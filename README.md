# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
STEP 1: Start

STEP 2: Load the California housing dataset and create a Pandas DataFrame for the features and target variables (AveOccup and HousingPrice).

STEP 3: Split the data into features (X) excluding AveOccup and HousingPrice, and target variables (Y) containing AveOccup and HousingPrice.

STEP 4: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

STEP 5: Standardize the training and testing sets using StandardScaler for both features and target variables.

STEP 6: Initialize the SGDRegressor and wrap it in a MultiOutputRegressor for multivariate predictions.

STEP 7: Train the model on the scaled training data.

STEP 8: Make predictions on the testing data using the trained model and inverse transform the predictions to original scale.

STEP 9: Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual target values.

STEP 10: Print the mean squared error and display the first 5 predicted values.

STEP 11: End
